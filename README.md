# Sauron2 in C++

Sauron 2 is a discrete event simulator build from scratch in C++.

The goals of this project are:
* Apply the TDD (test-driven development) principles using google test.
* Develop using clean code concepts.
* Learn and use C++14 features.
* Learn and use CMake.

The original SAURON project was originally developed for my Ph.D. thesis in C++ using the OMNeT++ framework.
However, as it was my first programming project apart from school homework, many things can be improved.
